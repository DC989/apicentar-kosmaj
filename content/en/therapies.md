## Hive air

Air from a beehive is rich in natural aerosols and bioactive substances with antiseptic, antioxidant, and regenerative properties. These substances positively affect the respiratory system, immune system, and nervous system, reducing inflammation and promoting relaxation. When inhaled, the active compounds are absorbed into the body, improving metabolism, respiratory function, and reducing stress. The combination of natural aromatherapy and the soothing sound of bees enhances sleep, concentration, and mental well-being.

## Vibrations

The vibrations emitted by bees, in the frequency range of 200â€“400 Hz, act as a natural micro-massage for the body, positively impacting joints, muscle tissue, and cellular regeneration. The aura of the bee colony creates a calming and healing environment, encouraging deep relaxation and improved overall health. Lying on top of beehives for 60 minutes can have an effect similar to eight hours of sleep, aiding in physical recovery and boosting energy levels.

## Sound

Sound apitherapy is a unique, natural, and completely non-invasive method that harnesses the power of nature and the bee community to harmonize the body and mind. The sound of the hive, resembling calming "white noise," creates a natural balance in the body, gently easing tension, reducing stress and anxiety, while also enhancing deep concentration and mental clarity.

## Negative ions

Negative ion therapy is a natural, non-invasive approach to health, inspired by the clean air found in forests, mountains, and near waterfalls. The air around a beehive is extremely rich in these ions, which support detoxification, improve circulation, and strengthen the immune system. Negative ions neutralize harmful positive ions from electronic devices, reduce stress, and improve sleep quality. Inhaling this energy-rich air helps the body regenerate naturally, while the mind experiences greater clarity and calm.
